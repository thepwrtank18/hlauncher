# Half-Life Launcher
A launcher for Half-Life. That's it. Run free with the software. You need Half-Life installed from Steam for this to work, along with it's expansions.
If you want the option for modded Half-Life to be in here, I can't. Steam adds a random ID to non-Steam games and mods, so it would always be wrong and the button wouldn't work.
